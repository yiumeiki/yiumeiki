# üöÄ 42 Piscine

Welcome to my repository showcasing my journey and projects completed during the **42 Piscine**. The Piscine is an intensive 4-week coding bootcamp that serves as a pre-selection process for the **42 Network**. It aims to evaluate adaptability, problem-solving skills, and the ability to learn new concepts quickly. 


## üéØ About 42 Piscine

42 Piscine is designed to evaluate your ability to learn, solve problems, and code under pressure. Throughout the program, I completed 79 projects (C00 to C11, including mandatory and bonus parts) and several rush projects. These projects covered a wide range of programming concepts, including algorithm design, memory management, and data structure implementation. The environment is peer-to-peer, self-paced, and collaborative, ensuring that all participants push each other to excel. 

### **Key Achievements:**
- **Break 42 London Record:** I became the **first ever person** to pass C10 in **42 London**.
- **Fast Learner & Smart Coder:** I completed the Piscine, including Rush 00 to Rush 02 and the BSQ project, quickly and efficiently, proving my ability to learn and adapt under pressure.
