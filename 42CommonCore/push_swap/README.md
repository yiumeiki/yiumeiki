# Push_swap
Developed an efficient algorithm to sort a stack using a restricted set of operations, focusing on time and space complexity. Implemented various sorting algorithms, including quick sort-inspired partitioning and optimized move sequences. The bonus part introduced additional functionalities, such as handling larger datasets with minimal operations.

## How to run
	make
	./push_swap <any numbers of argument in int>
	or
	make test(2/3/5/100/500)
